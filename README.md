# 31-10

10 years since the graduation, and a small gift for all of you, as a Flutter project.

## Getting Started (from official Flutter project setup)

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Idea

The app will serve as a 10 year graduation anniversary yearbook, where photos will be shared for:

- During high school class time;
- Dormitory stupid things;
- How people are doing after graduation.

Additionally, there'll be a section where people can leave messages + view all other anonymous 
messages.

Hope people will enjoy the idea and seeing all of the guys again.
